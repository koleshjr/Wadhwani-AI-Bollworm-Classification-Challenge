Can you improve a pest control app by classifying if an image contains a bollworm moth or not?


During the kharif season of 2017, cotton farmers across India lost large portions of their crop to a pest known as bollworms. Since then, farmers have been encouraged to install pheromone traps in their fields as part of a larger effort to control the problem. Pheromone traps capture male bollworms that are capable of reproducing. By counting the number of bollworms caught in such traps, farmers can estimate potential bollworm infestation to make informed decisions about whether pesticides should be applied to minimize future damage.

Wadhwani AI has developed a mobile app that allows farmers to take photographs of trap catches and receive recommendations based on AI-generated counts of pests in those images. One of the biggest challenges for the app is knowing when there are no pests in the image. This can happen because there actually were no pests caught in the trap. It can also occur when users are experimenting with the app outside of their fields â€“ during training sessions, or demonstrating the flow to friends.

When there are no pests in the image but the app says otherwise, user trust is immediately eroded.

Although the Wadhwani AI machine learning team has worked on this model for years, we are keen to explore new ideas for tackling the challenge. This competition is a step in that direction.

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model that classifies images as positive (contains bollworm moths) or negative (no bollworm moths). This model will form one part of the greater solution to control bollworm pests in India delivered by the Wadhwani AI app.
